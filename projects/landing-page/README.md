## Project Overview

This Project aims at manipulating the DOM of an existing HTML file styled with a seperate CSS file using Javascript. The Page initially was a static landing page with 3 sections and throught Javascript several changes were done.

## Manipulating the DOM - Changes made using JS

The the following was done using Javascript and some changes in the html and css original files to add functiality to the webpage:
•	More sections were added to the HTML file.
•	A dynamic navigation bar was built on top of the page that includes the sections titles as clickable links that scrolls the user down smoothly to the clicked section link. 
• Using Jquery, the navigation bar is made responsive to different screen widths to work smoothly on different devices.
•	While scrolling down the page, the style of the section appearing in the viewport changes to distinct the visible section from the rest of the page. (Active section moving with the scroll)
•	A 'go to top button' was created to take the user to the top of the page when clicked.

## General Notes

• The files contain comments explaining the JS coding used.
• There are 7 sections in the web page.
• Styling has been added for active states.
• All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.
• Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list (adds more menu items automatically when more sections are added to the HTML).
• The Project folder contains 4 files as follows:
- index.html
- styles.css
- app.js
- Readme.md
